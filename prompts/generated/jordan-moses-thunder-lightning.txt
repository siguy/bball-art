COMPOSITION: The card features two figures emerging from a cosmic, high-energy background.

LEFT FIGURE: Michael Jordan in a dynamic fadeaway jumper pose, wearing a generic pro basketball jersey in red, black, white with no logos or team names. athletic build, shaved head, intense focused expression. Stylized but recognizable artistic rendering, NOT a photograph.

RIGHT FIGURE: Moses in a regal, commanding, biblical prophet artistic style, holding wooden staff crackling with divine energy. long flowing beard, robes, weathered but powerful presence. Classical artistic interpretation.

INTERACTION: Standing back-to-back with arms crossed, looking outward with confidence and intensity
LEFT FIGURE (Michael Jordan): standing tall with arms crossed, looking over shoulder
RIGHT FIGURE (Moses): standing tall with arms crossed, facing opposite direction
ENERGY: confident, united, powerful allies

TOP SECTION: The title "THUNDER & LIGHTNING" written in a clean, bold, white 1990s sans-serif font with a subtle drop shadow. Below or overlapping the figures at the top center is the "COURT & COVENANT" brand logo in a smaller, sophisticated gold script.

BOTTOM SECTION: A simple, elegant bar with the names "Michael Jordan & Moses" in clean white text.

FINISH: The entire card has a high-gloss refractor finish with intense rim lighting and light-bending holographic effect.
