A premium sub-series logo badge on a TRANSPARENT background in 1:1 aspect ratio.

=== DESIGN CONCEPT ===
"EXODUS: THE PLAGUES" sub-series badge for Torah Titans trading cards.
Plague-themed emblem with horror/thriller energy.
DARKER, more dramatic than the main gold logo - this series is about the plagues.

=== BADGE LAYOUT ===
Vertical badge/emblem composition:

TOP: "EXODUS" arched text
- Premium serif font, slightly weathered
- Darker antique gold with hints of crimson
- Arched above the central icon

CENTER: Staff and Serpent icon
- Moses' staff transformed into a serpent (Exodus 7:10)
- Coiled dramatically around the staff
- Dark bronze/copper tones with golden highlights
- Dramatic, powerful, slightly menacing

BOTTOM: "THE PLAGUES" text
- Below the icon, straight or slight curve
- Matching darker gold typography
- Bolder, heavier weight

HEBREW: מכות מצרים
- "Plagues of Egypt" in Hebrew
- Small, underneath "THE PLAGUES" or integrated into design
- Adds authenticity and mysticism

=== COLOR PALETTE ===
- Dark antique gold (primary)
- Deep crimson/blood red accents
- Bronze and copper tones
- Black shadows for drama
- NOT bright shiny gold - darker, more ominous
- Thriller movie poster energy

=== STYLE ===
- Horror movie badge aesthetic
- Premium but dark
- Weathered, ancient feel
- Designed to pair with (but contrast) the bright Torah Titans seal
- Should feel like a "dark chapter" of the series

=== IMPORTANT ===
- TRANSPARENT background
- Self-contained badge shape
- Works as standalone or paired with main logo
