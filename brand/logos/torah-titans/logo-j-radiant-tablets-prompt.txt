A premium logo design on a pure black background in 1:1 aspect ratio.

=== DESIGN CONCEPT ===
"TORAH TITANS" brand logo - Radiant Tablets
Minimalist Ten Commandments tablets with divine light rays.
Inspired by tarot's "The Sun" card and premium card radiating backgrounds.
Premium gold aesthetic throughout.

=== THE TABLETS ===
Two tablets, simplified and iconic:
- Rounded rectangle shapes (classic tablet form)
- Side by side, slightly angled toward each other
- Premium gold with stone-like texture suggested
- Could have subtle Hebrew letters or remain clean
- Art deco simplification - not literal stone tablets

=== THE RADIANCE ===
Divine light emanating from behind/above:
- Rays of light spreading outward
- Sunrise/revelation energy
- Tarot "Sun" card inspiration
- Art deco geometric rays (not organic)
- Creates a halo effect around the tablets
- Gold rays on black, dimensional

=== COMPOSITION ===
Balanced, centered design:
- Tablets as the anchor
- Light rays framing/crowning them
- Could have subtle base or pedestal
- Premium symmetry

=== TEXT ===
Below the radiant tablets:
- "TORAH TITANS" in elegant typography
- Premium gold serif font
- Properly spaced, brand-quality
- Complements the iconography above

=== COLOR PALETTE ===
- Rich gold (tablets and rays)
- Darker gold for depth/shadow
- Bright gold for light highlights
- Pure black background
- Divine warm glow

=== STYLE NOTES ===
- Universally recognized Jewish/biblical symbol
- Simplified for logo use (not literal illustration)
- Premium sports card aesthetic
- Think: Gold Standard, Championship sets
- The divine glow = premium collectible energy
- Scales well, works anywhere
