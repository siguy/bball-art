# Project Brief: Court & Covenant

## 1. Vision & Vibe
**"Court & Covenant"** fuses 90s basketball nostalgia with ancient biblical history in a "Modern Luxury" digital aesthetic. We pair legends of the court with figures of the covenant, creating high-energy, art-insert styled collectibles.

**Aesthetic:** 
- **Base:** 90s Premium (Fleer Ultra "Thunder & Lightning", "Beam Team").
- **Finish:** 2020s Modern (Prizms, Refractors, Parallels).
- **Vibe:** Dark mode, glassmorphism, fluid motion.

## 2. Core Components

### A. The Content Pipeline ("Nano-Banana")
*Programmatic generation of unlicensed, stylized art.*
- **Inputs:** Basketball Player + Biblical Figure + 90s Insert Style.
- **Constraints:** NO NBA logos, team names, or licensed IP. Generic jerseys in team colors.
- **Outputs:** 
  - 2 distinct variants per pairing.
  - Motion assets (Start/End frames for social loops).
- **Example Prompt Structure:**
  > "Vertical 90s premium card. [Player] in [Color] jersey (no logos) vs [Biblical Figure]. Background: Cosmic/Electric [Style]. Text: 'COURT & COVENANT'."

### B. The Web Experience
*Interactive gallery and storefront.*
- **Key Feature:** Digital "Pack Opening" UX.
- **Commerce:** Sell individual series cards & physical posters.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for that "Modern Luxury" feel).

### C. The Game
*NBA Jam-style Arcade App.*
- **Gameplay:** 2v2 arcade action using the stylized pairings.
- **Visuals:** Match the "Refractor/Beam Team" aesthetic.

## 3. Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Art & Social Proof
1.  Define the initial "Series 1" pairings list.
2.  Build the "Nano-Banana" prompt templates for 3 distinct styles (e.g., Thunder, Ethereal, High-Voltage).
3.  Generate the first batch of assets (Images + Motion Clips).
4.  Launch Social Media teaser campaign.

### Phase 2: The Digital Storefront (MVP)
1.  Scaffold Next.js + Tailwind project.
2.  Implement the "Pack Opening" animation module.
3.  Set up e-commerce backend (Stripe/Shopify).

### Phase 3: The Arcade
1.  Prototype game mechanics (Movement, "Slap Five" interaction).
2.  Integrate generated art assets as sprites/backgrounds.

## 4. Immediate Next Step
Refine the "Nano-Banana" prompt variable list to generate the first 5 test cards.
