    "relationship": "The archetypal sibling rivalry. The Midrash (Genesis Rabbah 63:6) says they fought even in the womb \u2014 'this one ran to kill that one.' When Rebekah passed synagogues, Jacob convulsed to emerge; near idol worship, Esau struggled out. Jacob is 'chalak' (smooth) = God's portion; Esau is 'sa'ir' (hairy) = connected to demons (Gen. Rabbah 65:15). Their conflict became a cosmic principle: 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, the hands are the hands of Esau' \u2014 when Jacob's voice fills the study halls, Esau's hands have no power (Gen. Rabbah 65:20). The prophet Obadiah sealed their fate: 'The House of Jacob shall be fire, the House of Esau shall be straw.'",
