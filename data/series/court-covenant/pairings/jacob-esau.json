    "relationship": "The archetypal sibling rivalry. The Midrash (Genesis Rabbah 63:6) says they fought even in the womb — 'this one ran to kill that one.' When Rebekah passed synagogues, Jacob convulsed to emerge; near idol worship, Esau struggled out. Jacob is 'chalak' (smooth) = God's portion; Esau is 'sa'ir' (hairy) = connected to demons (Gen. Rabbah 65:15). Their conflict became a cosmic principle: 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, the hands are the hands of Esau' — when Jacob's voice fills the study halls, Esau's hands have no power (Gen. Rabbah 65:20). The prophet Obadiah sealed their fate: 'The House of Jacob shall be fire, the House of Esau shall be straw.'",

        "title": "The War in the Womb",
        "description": "The Midrash says they fought before birth — 'this one ran to kill that one.' When Rebekah passed synagogues, Jacob convulsed to emerge; near houses of idol worship, Esau struggled out. The rivalry was prenatal and cosmic."
      },
      {
        "title": "The Birthright Bargain",
        "description": "Jacob cunningly persuaded a famished Esau to sell his birthright for a bowl of lentil stew. The Midrash notes Esau emerged first only so 'his corruption would depart' — like a bathhouse attendant cleaning before the king's son bathes."
      },
      {
        "title": "The Stolen Blessing",
        "description": "With Rebekah's help, Jacob deceived his blind father Isaac. The Midrash (Gen. Rabbah 65:15) says Jacob went 'compelled, coerced, and weeping.' Isaac told him to approach so he could feel him — and spoke the words that became a cosmic principle: 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.'"

      {
        "title": "Esau's Cosmic Cry",
        "description": "When Esau discovered the deception, he cried 'a very great and bitter cry.' The Midrash (Gen. Rabbah 67:4) connects this cry across history to Mordechai's bitter cry in Shushan — Jacob's deception of Esau echoed through generations to the Purim story."

        "title": "Fire vs Straw",
        "description": "The prophet Obadiah declared: 'The House of Jacob shall be fire, the House of Joseph flame, and the House of Esau shall be straw.' The Midrash (Gen. Rabbah 84:5) says when Jacob feared Esau's chieftains, God told him: 'One spark from you and one from your son will burn all of them.'"

        "title": "The Reunion",
        "description": "Years later, Jacob returned with his family and bowed seven times. Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, and they wept. But the Midrash debates whether the kiss was sincere — dots above the Hebrew word 'kissed him' hint at ambiguity."

Dark red-crimson energy radiates from him. Umbilical cord visible. Wild and aggressive even before birth, demon silhouettes flickering behind him.",
        "scene": "Inside a SHARED COSMIC WOMB — both babies suspended together in the same amniotic space, an ethereal oval membrane surrounding them both. They FACE EACH OTHER across the womb. Swirling energies of blue (Jacob's side) and red (Esau's side) divide the space. Torah/synagogue silhouettes on Jacob's side, idol/demon shadows on Esau's side. Mythic and cosmic, not realistic.",
