## Planned Pairings (5 New)

These pairings are ready for implementation:

### 1. Tim Duncan + Bezalel (HERO)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | hero |
| **Era** | 2000s |
| **Templates** | metal-universe, prizm-silver |
| **Connection** | Master craftsmen who built something lasting through fundamentals |
| **Narrative** | "The Tabernacle required precision. So did the Spurs dynasty." |

**Why it works:** Duncan's "Big Fundamental" nickname is perfect for Bezalel, the artisan who built the Tabernacle with God-given skill. Both valued excellence through craft, not flash. Five championships, quiet excellence, fundamentals over flash.

**Key Research:**
- Duncan: Bank shot, defensive anchor, emotionless demeanor, "boring" greatness
- Bezalel: Exodus 31:1-11 (divine wisdom for craftsmanship), built Ark of Covenant

---

### 2. Hakeem Olajuwon + Abraham (HERO)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | hero |
| **Era** | 1990s |
| **Templates** | thunder-lightning, beam-team |
| **Connection** | Both called from other lands, became fathers of dynasties |
| **Narrative** | "From Nigeria to Houston. From Ur to Canaan. Journeys of faith." |

**Why it works:** Hakeem's journey from Lagos to NBA champion mirrors Abraham's call to leave everything. Both devout (Hakeem converted to Islam, observed Ramadan during playoffs), both foundational to what followed. "The Dream" + "Father of Nations."

**Key Research:**
- Hakeem: Dream Shake, footwork, blocked shots, 1994-95 back-to-back titles without Jordan
- Abraham: Genesis 12 (the call), binding of Isaac, covenant promises

---

### 3. Bill Russell + Nehemiah (HERO)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | hero |
| **Era** | 1960s |
| **Templates** | metal-universe, prizm-silver |
| **Connection** | Leaders who rebuilt under oppression, won against all odds |
| **Narrative** | "11 rings. 52 days to rebuild the wall. Impossible made real." |

**Why it works:** Russell fought for civil rights while winning championships in a hostile environment. Nehemiah rebuilt Jerusalem while enemies mocked and threatened. Both proved doubters wrong through action, not words. Ultimate winners in hostile territory.

**Key Research:**
- Russell: 11 championships, player-coach, civil rights activism, defensive genius
- Nehemiah: Book of Nehemiah (rebuilding walls), cupbearer to king, leader under pressure

---

### 4. Karl Malone + Balaam (VILLAIN)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | villain |
| **Era** | 1990s |
| **Templates** | thunder-lightning-dark, metal-universe-dark |
| **Connection** | Hired to deliver, but couldn't finish the job when it mattered |
| **Narrative** | "The Mailman always delivers. Except in the Finals. Balaam couldn't curse." |

**Why it works:** Malone was the reliable scorer who couldn't win the big one (0-3 in Finals). Balaam was hired to curse Israel but the words kept coming out as blessings. Both had the talent but failed at the crucial moment. Both mercenary figures.

**Key Research:**
- Malone: 36,928 points (2nd all-time), pick-and-roll with Stockton, Finals losses to Bulls/Pistons
- Balaam: Numbers 22-24 (talking donkey, failed curses), prophet for hire

---

### 5. Patrick Ewing + Saul (VILLAIN)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | villain |
| **Era** | 1990s |
| **Templates** | thunder-lightning-dark, beam-team-shadow |
| **Connection** | So close to greatness, tormented by the one who came after |
| **Narrative** | "Both wore the crown. Both watched someone else take it." |

**Why it works:** Ewing was the king of New York who never won, always overshadowed by Jordan. Saul was king but tormented by David's rise. Tragic figures with all the tools but not the destiny. Both tall, imposing, yet ultimately failed.

**Key Research:**
- Ewing: Georgetown, #1 pick, 1994 Finals (blocked shot), perennial All-Star
- Saul: 1 Samuel 9-31 (anointing to death), jealousy of David, tragic decline

---

## Methodology: Finding Good Pairings

### Thematic Connection Categories

When matching a player to a biblical figure, look for parallels in:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Leadership Style** | How they led (quiet vs. vocal, fear vs. love) | Duncan/Bezalel (quiet excellence) |
| **Origin Story** | Humble beginnings, unexpected rise | Hakeem/Abraham (called from elsewhere) |
| **Signature Moment** | Defining achievement or turning point | Jordan/Moses (parting the defense/sea) |
| **Character Trait** | Wisdom, strength, cunning, loyalty | Kareem/Solomon (wisdom, longevity) |
| **Role in Story** | Successor, rebel, protector, prophet | Kobe/Joshua (succeeded the GOAT) |
| **Tragic Flaw** | Hubris, temper, trust issues | Ewing/Saul (couldn't escape shadow) |

### Good Pairing Criteria

A pairing should have:

1. **Clear narrative parallel** - Not forced, immediately resonant
2. **Visual potential** - Poses that work together aesthetically
3. **Quote material** - Biblical text that can caption the card
4. **Era compatibility** - Template style that fits the player's era
5. **Fills a gap** - Archetype not already covered

### Red Flags (Avoid)

- Superficial connections (both tall, both #23)
- Figures already used
- Obscure figures with no good quotes
- Players too similar to existing pairings
- Connections that require explanation

---

## Research Process

### Step 1: Player Research

Gather the following for each NBA player:

```
□ Full name and common nicknames
□ Position and jersey number(s)
□ Era (decade they were dominant)
□ Team(s) associated with
□ Physical description (height, build, distinguishing features)
□ 4-6 signature moves/poses
□ Playing style archetype
□ Key career moments
□ Championships/major awards
□ Jersey colors (primary and secondary)
```

**Sources:**
- Basketball Reference (stats, accolades)
- YouTube (signature moves, celebrations)
- Wikipedia (career narrative)
- Sports Illustrated / ESPN articles (personality, style)

### Step 2: Figure Research

Gather the following for each biblical figure:

```
□ Primary biblical source (book/chapter)
□ Key story moments
□ Physical description (if available)
□ Attribute/item associated with them
□ Clothing/visual style
□ Archetype (leader, warrior, prophet, etc.)
□ 5-8 quotable verses (Hebrew + English)
□ Emotional range (moods across their story)
```

**Sources:**
- Sefaria.org (primary texts, translations)
- Jewish Encyclopedia
- Torah.org commentaries
- Wikipedia (overview)

### Step 3: Connection Mapping

Write out:

```
1. THEMATIC: One sentence on the shared theme
2. NARRATIVE: A punchy tagline for the card
3. RELATIONSHIP: How they'd interact if they met
4. VISUAL: What poses would look good together
```

### Step 4: Quote Selection

Find 5-8 quotes that:
- Come from key moments in the figure's story
- Have memorable English translations
- Work as card captions
- Cover different moods (triumph, struggle, wisdom)

## Testing Your Pairing

### Step 1: Validate JSON

```bash
# Check each file parses correctly
node -e "require('./data/series/court-covenant/pairings/{pairing}.json')"
node -e "require('./data/poses/players/{player}.json')"
node -e "require('./data/poses/figures/{figure}.json')"
node -e "require('./data/quotes/figures/{figure}.json')"
```

### Step 2: List Available Poses

```bash
node scripts/generate-with-poses.js {pairing-id} --list-poses
```

This should show all poses for both characters.

### Step 3: Dry Run

```bash
node scripts/generate-with-poses.js {pairing-id} thunder-lightning \
  --player-pose {pose-id} --figure-pose {pose-id} --dry-run
```

Review the generated prompt for issues.

### Step 4: Generate Test Card

Use the Generator UI:
1. Start visualizer: `cd visualizer && npm start`
2. Go to http://localhost:3333/generator.html
3. Select your pairing
4. Choose template and poses
5. Generate and review

### Step 5: Iterate

Common issues to fix:
- **Poses don't match**: Adjust energy/composition
- **Quote doesn't fit**: Try different quoteId
- **Visual too busy**: Simplify pose descriptions
- **Connection unclear**: Strengthen narrative tagline

```

**Testing:**
```bash
node -e "require('./data/quotes/figures/nehemiah.json')"
node -e "require('./data/poses/figures/nehemiah.json')"
node -e "require('./data/poses/players/russell.json')"
node -e "require('./data/series/court-covenant/pairings/russell-nehemiah.json')"

node scripts/generate-with-poses.js russell-nehemiah --list-poses

node scripts/generate-with-poses.js russell-nehemiah metal-universe \
  --player-pose championship-banner --figure-pose completion-celebration --dry-run
```

**Checkpoint:** □ Test card generated and reviewed

## Final Verification

After all 5 pairings are complete:

```bash
# Verify all 24 pairings load
node -e "
  const fs = require('fs');
  const dir = './data/series/court-covenant/pairings';
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.json'));
  console.log('Total pairings:', files.length);
  files.forEach(f => {
    const p = require('./' + dir + '/' + f);
    console.log('✓', p.id, '(' + p.type + ')');
  });
"

# Update CLAUDE.md inventory (move from Planned to active tables)

# Generate full test set via Generator UI
# - One card per new pairing
# - Test both hero and villain templates as appropriate

# Review all in visualizer gallery
# - Rate each card
# - Note any prompt adjustments needed
```

**Final checklist:**
```
□ All 20 new JSON files created and validated
□ All 5 pairings show in Generator UI dropdown
□ All poses load correctly for each pairing
□ Test cards generated for each pairing
□ Cards reviewed in visualizer
□ CLAUDE.md updated (pairings moved from Planned to active tables)
□ Commit all changes with descriptive message
```

## Questions?

Ask Claude to help with:
- "Research [biblical figure] for a pairing with [player]"
- "Find quotes from [book] for [figure]"
- "What poses would work for [player]?"
- "Does [player] + [figure] make sense as a pairing?"
