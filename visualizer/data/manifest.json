      "prompt": "A vertical premium collectible card in 3:4 aspect ratio. Classic TAROT CARD style with realistic detail.\n\n=== CORE CONCEPT ===\nThe Mem (מ) is not a symbol floating in the image — it IS THE ATOM. Every node in the molecular structure is a tiny Mem. The entire universe of this card is built from Mem-molecules. You must look closely to see that the building blocks of reality are the Hebrew letter itself.\n\n=== STYLE ===\nCLASSIC TAROT with REALISTIC DETAIL. Not psychedelic abstraction — grounded, painterly, believable. Think: a scene you could step into, rendered with the care of a master illustrator. The molecular structures should feel like scientific illustration, precise and beautiful.\n\n=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===\n1. TINY MEMS AS ATOMS — every molecular node is a small מ character\n2. REALISTIC RENDERING — painterly, detailed, not abstract\n3. Classic tarot composition and framing\n4. Elaborate border with wells, water, molecules, and tambourine imagery\n5. Miriam as central figure, realistically rendered\n6. The figure must have exactly TWO ARMS\n\n=== THE MEM-MOLECULAR STRUCTURE ===\nThe molecular lattices that fill the scene are made of TINY MEMS:\n- Where you would normally see atomic nodes (circles/spheres), you see small מ letters\n- The Mems connect to each other with bond lines, forming hexagonal water-crystal patterns\n- SCALE: The Mems are SMALL — like seeing atoms, you need to look closely\n- Thousands of tiny Mems forming the crystalline structure of water\n- The bonds between Mems follow water's geometry (104.5° angles, hexagonal ice lattice)\n- The overall effect: a beautiful molecular diagram where the atoms ARE the letter\n- The structures should feel SCIENTIFIC — like an illustration from a chemistry text, but sacred\n\n=== MIRIAM — REALISTICALLY RENDERED ===\nMiriam the prophetess as central figure:\n- REALISTIC PORTRAITURE — not stylized, believable as a person\n- Mature woman, perhaps 50s-60s, dignified and serene\n- Dark hair with silver-grey streaks, loosely covered with head cloth\n- Weathered skin from desert life, but radiant\n- Wearing layered desert robes — linen, earth tones, blue accents\n- Expression: quiet wisdom, inner peace, gentle strength\n- Pose: Standing or seated beside her well, one hand perhaps touching the water\n- She may hold or have nearby her TAMBOURINE (timbrel) — her other symbol\n- Realistically proportioned, anatomically correct\n- Lighting: soft, warm, as if late afternoon desert light\n\n=== THE WELL ===\nMiriam's well as a grounding element:\n- A stone well, realistically rendered — ancient, hand-carved stones\n- Water within glows subtly with the Mem-molecular structure\n- When you look into the well, you see the lattice of tiny Mems\n- Green plants growing around its base — life in the desert\n- The well feels REAL, touchable, ancient\n\n=== BACKGROUND/ENVIRONMENT ===\nDesert oasis setting, realistically painted:\n- Sandy terrain, distant hills, clear sky\n- But the AIR itself subtly contains the Mem-molecular structure\n- Like seeing the hidden architecture of water vapor in the atmosphere\n- The molecular lattice is present but doesn't overwhelm the realistic scene\n- It's there when you look for it — the secret structure underlying reality\n\n=== THE BORDER — SYMBOLIC TAROT FRAME ===\nElaborate traditional tarot border incorporating Miriam's symbols:\n\nCORNER ELEMENTS:\n- Wells (circular well openings viewed from above)\n- Tambourines/timbrels (circular with decorative patterns)\n- These alternate or combine in the four corners\n\nSIDE PANELS:\n- Flowing water patterns, waves, ripples\n- Molecular diagrams with tiny Mem-nodes woven into decorative patterns\n- Perhaps water vessels, jugs, cups\n\nTOP BORDER:\n- Architectural banner for title\n- Could incorporate well arch or water motif\n\nBOTTOM BORDER:\n- Matching architectural element\n- Space for card name\n\nBORDER STYLE:\n- Gold/bronze metallic finish\n- Art Nouveau organic curves meeting geometric molecular patterns\n- Realistic rendering — this border could be a carved frame\n- Aged patina, feels ancient and precious\n\n=== COLOR PALETTE ===\nRealistic, naturalistic colors:\n- MIRIAM: Earth tones, cream linen, touches of blue, warm skin tones\n- WELL: Grey-brown stone, green moss, blue water\n- BACKGROUND: Desert golds, warm sand, blue sky\n- MOLECULAR STRUCTURES: Soft blue glow, translucent, not overwhelming\n- BORDER: Antique gold, bronze, warm metallics\n- Overall: WARM and GROUNDED, not cold/clinical\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS ===\nIntegrated into border, classic tarot typography:\n\nTOP BANNER: \"גִּבּוֹרֵי תּוֹרָה\" — elegant gold lettering\n\nSUBTITLE: \"אוֹתִיּוֹת הָאֵם\" — smaller, below\n\nBOTTOM BANNER: \"באר מרים\" — the well of Miriam\n\nCARD NAME: \"מִרְיָם הַנְּבִיאָה\" — Miriam the Prophetess\n\n=== THE EFFECT ===\nAt first glance: a beautiful tarot card of a woman at a well in the desert.\nOn closer inspection: the water, the air, reality itself is made of tiny Mems.\nThe letter is not a symbol — it is the substance of creation.\nMiriam knew the secret structure of water. That's why the well followed her.",

      "prompt": "A vertical premium collectible card in 3:4 aspect ratio. PSYCHEDELIC MOLECULAR TAROT.\n\n=== STYLE ===\nDense molecular mysticism FRAMED by classic tarot card border. The contrast matters: ornate traditional border containing infinite molecular depth. Alex Grey's visions presented in Rider-Waite's frame.\n\n=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===\n1. ELABORATE TAROT BORDER — gold/bronze, traditional card frame with decorative corners and panels\n2. DENSE MOLECULAR FIELD inside the border — hexagonal lattices, hydrogen bonds, fractal detail\n3. MULTIPLE GHOST MEMS — the letter מ appears SEVERAL TIMES at different scales, subtle, ghostly\n4. Miriam as grounding presence within the molecular vision\n5. The figure must have exactly TWO ARMS\n6. The border contains the psychedelic infinity within\n\n=== THE TAROT BORDER ===\nClassic tarot card frame surrounding the molecular interior:\n- ORNATE CORNERS with decorative flourishes — traditional card styling\n- TOP BANNER for title text — architectural, formal\n- BOTTOM BANNER for card name — matching top\n- SIDE PANELS with subtle geometric patterns that hint at molecular structure\n- Color: Antique gold, bronze, aged metal patina\n- Style: Art Nouveau meets medieval manuscript meets traditional tarot\n- The border is SOLID, GROUNDING — it contains the chaos within\n- Width: substantial — this is a proper frame, not a thin line\n- The border should feel ANCIENT while the interior feels like infinite depth\n\n=== THE MOLECULAR INTERIOR ===\nInside the border, DENSE WATER MOLECULE STRUCTURES fill the space:\n- Thousands of H₂O molecules in vast networks\n- Hydrogen bonds as delicate connecting lines\n- HEXAGONAL ICE CRYSTAL LATTICES tessellating and overlapping\n- Fractal depth — patterns within patterns within patterns\n- Color: Deep indigo → cyan → electric blue → white highlights\n- The structure should feel INFINITE, continuing beyond what we see\n- Concentric ripples or waves radiating through the molecular field\n- Bioluminescent glow from within\n\n=== MULTIPLE GHOST MEMS ===\nThe Hebrew letter מ appears MULTIPLE TIMES throughout the molecular field:\n- NOT as solid letters — as SUGGESTIONS within the pattern\n- One LARGE ghost Mem in the upper portion — formed by subtle color shift or alignment of molecules\n- TWO or THREE SMALLER ghost Mems scattered at different scales\n- Each Mem emerges from the molecular structure differently:\n  - One formed by brighter luminosity in that region\n  - One formed by denser clustering of molecules\n  - One formed by alignment of hexagonal edges\n  - One as subtle negative space\n- The Mems should feel DISCOVERED, not placed\n- Like seeing patterns in clouds — there if you look, invisible if you don't\n- They overlap the molecular structure, not separate from it\n- Different sizes: large (taking up 1/3 of interior), medium, small\n\n=== MIRIAM — THE STILL CENTER ===\nMiriam is present but the molecular field dominates:\n- Positioned in LOWER THIRD, partially within the bottom border area\n- Smaller scale — she is human-sized in an infinite molecular cosmos\n- Eyes closed in meditation or vision — she SEES this structure\n- Serene expression — at peace within the overwhelming detail\n- Her robes dissolve into molecular patterns at the edges\n- She emerges FROM the molecular field, connected to it\n- Surrounded by crystalline formations or emerging from the well\n- She is the human anchor in abstract infinity\n\n=== COLOR PALETTE ===\n- INTERIOR: Deep indigo, midnight blue, electric cyan, white nodes, subtle magenta in deep layers\n- BORDER: Antique gold, bronze, aged brass, warm metallic patina\n- CONTRAST: Warm gold border vs cool blue interior creates visual separation\n- Miriam: Blue-grey robes with gold accents, connecting border and interior\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\n- BORDER: 15-20% of card on each edge — substantial traditional frame\n- INTERIOR: Dense molecular field filling the framed space\n- GHOST MEMS: Layered throughout at varying scales and intensities\n- MIRIAM: Lower third, grounding element, partial overlap with border\n- The eye moves: border → molecular field → discovers Mems → finds Miriam → wanders in detail\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS ===\nText on the BORDER, not floating in the molecular field:\n\nTOP BANNER: \"גִּבּוֹרֵי תּוֹרָה\" in elegant gold lettering on the border\n\nTOP SUBTITLE: \"אוֹתִיּוֹת הָאֵם • מַיִם\" smaller, below main title\n\nBOTTOM BANNER: \"באר מרים\" centered in bottom border panel\n\nBOTTOM: \"מִרְיָם הַנְּבִיאָה\" at very bottom of border\n\n=== THE EFFECT ===\nTraditional tarot framing containing infinite molecular depth.\nThe border says: this is a sacred card, a contained vision.\nThe interior says: water's structure is infinite, fractal, alive.\nThe ghost Mems say: the letter is not imposed, it emerges from reality itself.\nMiriam says: a human can hold this vision, can carry this well.",

      "prompt": "A vertical premium collectible card in 3:4 aspect ratio. PSYCHEDELIC MOLECULAR MYSTICISM meets tarot.\n\n=== STYLE: PSYCHEDELIC MOLECULAR ===\nDense, intricate, overwhelming detail. The molecular structure of water rendered as sacred fractal geometry. The Hebrew letter Mem (מ) should be HIDDEN within the pattern — discoverable, not obvious. Think: Alex Grey meets chemistry textbook meets Kabbalistic meditation diagram.\n\n=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===\n1. DENSE MOLECULAR DETAIL — hydrogen bonds, crystal lattices, fractal branching\n2. The letter MEM (מ) is SUBTLE — hidden in the geometry, emerging from the pattern, not a clear glyph\n3. PSYCHEDELIC INTENSITY — intricate, layered, rewards close looking\n4. Miriam as grounding human presence within the overwhelming structure\n5. The figure must have exactly TWO ARMS\n6. This should feel like staring into the infinite structure of water itself\n\n=== THE MOLECULAR FIELD ===\nThe entire card is filled with DENSE WATER MOLECULE STRUCTURES:\n- Thousands of H₂O molecules in various arrangements\n- Hydrogen bonds rendered as delicate connecting lines forming vast networks\n- HEXAGONAL ICE CRYSTAL LATTICES tessellating and overlapping\n- The 104.5° bond angle repeated fractally at multiple scales\n- Molecules cluster, branch, form dendrite patterns like frost on glass\n- PHASE TRANSITIONS visible: liquid chaos becoming crystalline order\n- The structure should feel INFINITE — continuing beyond the card edges\n- Multiple layers of detail: macro patterns containing micro patterns containing molecular patterns\n- Color gradients shift through the molecular field: deep blue → cyan → white → back to blue\n\n=== THE HIDDEN MEM ===\nThe Hebrew letter מ is NOT drawn as a letter. Instead:\n- The shape EMERGES from the molecular structure itself\n- A region where the hexagons align to suggest the letter's form\n- Or a negative space where bonds are absent\n- Or a color shift / luminosity change that traces the letter\n- The viewer should DISCOVER the Mem, not be shown it\n- It's there when you look for it, invisible when you don't\n- Like seeing a shape in clouds or a face in static\n\n=== MIRIAM — THE STILL POINT ===\nMiriam is the calm center in the molecular storm:\n- Smaller in frame than previous versions — the structure dominates\n- She could be WITHIN the molecular field, surrounded by it\n- Or she is the SOURCE — the molecules emanate from her\n- Serene face, eyes closed or gazing inward\n- Her form is solid while everything around her vibrates with detail\n- Robes that DISSOLVE into molecular patterns at the edges\n- She is not separate from the water — she is part of its structure\n- Positioned lower in the composition, grounding element\n\n=== PSYCHEDELIC ELEMENTS ===\nPush the visual intensity:\n- CONCENTRIC RIPPLES of molecular structure radiating outward\n- FRACTAL BRANCHING — patterns that repeat at different scales\n- INTERFERENCE PATTERNS where crystal lattices overlap\n- Subtle CYMATICS — standing wave patterns in the structure\n- BIOLUMINESCENT GLOW from within the molecular network\n- The sense that the structure is ALIVE, vibrating, breathing\n- Depth illusion — some molecular layers in front, some behind\n- The whole image should reward STARING — more detail emerges over time\n\n=== COLOR PALETTE ===\nPsychedelic but cold/aquatic:\n- Deep indigo and midnight blue as base\n- Electric cyan and turquoise for molecular bonds\n- White/silver for nodes and highlights\n- Subtle purple and magenta shifts in the deeper layers\n- NO warm colors — this is water's realm\n- Luminosity variations create depth and movement\n- The overall effect: GLOWING FROM WITHIN\n\n=== BORDER ===\nThe border should CONTINUE the molecular pattern:\n- Not a frame that contains, but a boundary that the structure crosses\n- Hexagonal tessellation that becomes more ordered at the edges\n- Or: no distinct border — the pattern fades to dark at edges\n- Hebrew text integrated into the molecular structure, not separate\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (MINIMAL, INTEGRATED) ===\nText should feel like part of the pattern, not labels:\n\nTOP: \"גִּבּוֹרֵי תּוֹרָה\" — small, elegant, could be formed from molecular nodes\n\nBOTTOM: \"באר מרים\" — emerging from the structure\n\nThe letter labels (מ • מים) can be VERY subtle or absent — the image speaks for itself\n\n\"מִרְיָם\" somewhere, perhaps near her figure\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\n- The molecular structure fills 80%+ of the card\n- Miriam is a presence within it, not separate from it\n- No clear \"background\" vs \"foreground\" — it's all interconnected\n- The eye should wander, discover, get lost\n- Dense but not chaotic — there's underlying order (the crystal geometry)\n\n=== FINISH ===\nThis should feel like a vision, a meditation, a glimpse into the hidden structure of reality.\nWater is not just wet — it's architecture, it's geometry, it's sacred pattern.\nMiriam knew this. She carried the well because she understood water's secret nature.",

The Tabernacle's inauguration, meant to be the peak of celebration.\nNadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, have offered unauthorized fire before the Lord.\nDivine fire answers — two threads descending from the Holy of Holies.\n\n=== THE SHIN — DIVINE FIRE ===\nThe Hebrew letter ש dominates the upper two-thirds of the card, formed entirely of sacred flame:\n- The THREE PRONGS of the Shin are three columns of fire\n- The LEFT and RIGHT prongs curve downward, becoming two threads of fire that reach toward the brothers\n- The CENTER prong rises highest, the source — fire from before the Lord (מִלִּפְנֵי יְהוָה)\n- The fire is not orange but WHITE-HOT at the core, edged with gold and consuming red\n\n=== NADAB & ABIHU — CONSUMED ===\nThe two brothers stand within the Shin's flames, one in the left prong, one in the right:\n- Their forms are SILHOUETTES — dark shapes dissolving into the letter itself\n- But their PRIESTLY GARMENTS remain visible: white linen ephods, pristine, untouched by flame\n- The garments float within the fire like ghosts of the men who wore them\n- Two threads of fire enter where their faces were — the fire that consumed their souls, not their bodies\n- Their מַחְתּוֹת (censers) fall from their hands, frozen mid-descent\n- Their strange fire (small, orange, mortal) rises from the falling censers, meeting the divine white fire above\n\n=== AARON — THE SILENT WITNESS ===\nAaron stands in the foreground, below the Shin, facing away from us toward his sons:\n- He is SOLID, not dissolving — the one who remains\n- High Priest garments: blue robe, golden breastplate, but all color muted by grief\n- His posture is rigid, frozen — וַיִּדֹּם אַהֲרֹן (and Aaron was silent)\n- His hands hang at his sides, neither reaching nor covering his face\n- In his EYES, visible in profile or three-quarter view, the SHIN is REFLECTED — the fire mirrored in his gaze\n- He does not look away\n\n=== BACKGROUND ===\nBehind the Shin, the Tabernacle is visible:\n- The mishkan curtains, the altar, the structure of sacred space\n- But all in GREY and ASH tones — the celebration frozen, joy turned to mourning\n- The eighth day that should have been golden is now the color of smoke\n- Other figures (Israelites, priests) are mere shadows at the edges, distant, horrified\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\n- UPPER 2/3: The Shin of fire with the brothers dissolving within it\n- LOWER 1/3: Aaron in the foreground, solid, watching\n- The Shin should feel MASSIVE, divine, terrible\n- Aaron should feel SMALL against it, yet unmoving\n\n=== COLOR PALETTE ===\n- Primary: White-hot fire core, divine gold edges\n- Secondary: Blood red, consuming orange in the flames\n- Contrast: Ash grey (background), pure white (priestly garments untouched)\n- Aaron: Muted blues and golds, grief-dulled\n\n=== BORDER & FRAME ===\nDark bronze border, nearly black, with subtle ember particles drifting upward.\nThe border feels like the edge of something sacred that has been breached.\nFaint Hebrew text along the edges — בִּקְרֹבַי אֶקָּדֵשׁ וְעַל־פְּנֵי כׇל־הָעָם אֶכָּבֵד\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified, ALL IN HEBREW) ===\nTOP: Write \"גִּבּוֹרֵי תּוֹרָה\" in bronze metallic font, darkened as if by smoke.\n\nSUBTITLE: Below, write \"אוֹתִיּוֹת הָאֵם\" in small caps, ember glow.\n\nELEMENT: Write \"ש • אֵשׁ\" large and elegant.\n\nBOTTOM: Write \"אֵשׁ זָרָה\" centered.\n\nNAMES: Write \"נָדָב וַאֲבִיהוּא • אַהֲרֹן\" below, separated by a flame symbol.\n\n=== FINISH ===\nSomber metallic finish. The fire should seem to flicker at the edges.\nThis is a card about loss, about the cost of coming too close without permission.\nPremium collectible weight with the gravity of tragedy.\n",

Washington bursts through the very frame meant to honor him, ascending beyond the boundaries of memorialization itself.\n\n=== THE FRAME ===\nBEAUX-ARTS PICTURE FRAME:\n- Ornate, heavy gilded frame visible on the card\n- The kind that holds civic portraits in Gilded Age institutions\n- Elaborate gold leaf ornamentation, classical motifs\n- Acanthus leaves, egg-and-dart molding, scrollwork\n- BUT: The frame is CRACKING, BREAKING\n- Gold leaf peeling away, fragments flying outward\n- The frame cannot hold what's inside\n\n=== WASHINGTON ASCENDING ===\nTHE APOTHEOSIS:\n- Washington in the center, RISING UPWARD\n- Breaking through the top of the frame\n- Robed in classical attire: purple and white robes, toga-like\n- Arms perhaps raised or spread in ascension\n- Expression: transcendent, beyond mortal concerns\n- He is becoming MORE than the frame can hold\n\nMOTION AND ENERGY:\n- Strong upward diagonal movement\n- Clouds swirling around him, parting for his ascent\n- Golden divine light from above\n- The moment of breakthrough captured\n\n=== ALLEGORICAL FIGURES ===\nSpilling out of the frame alongside Washington:\n- LIBERTY: Female figure with Phrygian cap, breaking free\n- VICTORY: Winged figure with laurel wreath\n- FAME: Figure with trumpet, announcing the ascension\n- These figures overflow the frame's edges\n- Not contained, not controllable\n\n=== THE BREAKING ===\n- Frame cracking at the top where Washington pushes through\n- Gold leaf fragments suspended in air\n- Pieces of ornate molding falling away\n- The destruction is beautiful, not violent\n- Like a chrysalis breaking open\n\n=== COLOR PALETTE ===\n- Rich gold of gilded frame\n- Deep purple and white of classical robes\n- Warm flesh tones against cool clouds\n- Divine golden light from above\n- The specific palette of Brumidi's Capitol frescoes\n- Cream, rose, gold, cerulean blue\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\n- The gilded frame creates a frame-within-frame\n- Washington's figure breaks the upper boundary\n- Allegorical figures spill past the sides\n- Creates layered depth: card edge > broken frame > ascending figure\n- Dynamic, not static\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS ===\nTOP: \"FOUNDING FATHERS\" perhaps ON the breaking frame, fragmenting with it\nLAYER BADGE: \"Industrial Monument\" - styled like a Gilded Age plaque\nBOTTOM: \"Washington\" with \"1776-2026 | 250 Years\" - below the breaking frame\n\n=== FINISH ===\nGilded Age civic mural quality:\n- The specific look of Brumidi, Blashfield, Cox murals\n- Gold leaf texture where appropriate\n- Classical figure rendering\n- But with dynamic, explosive energy\n- Premium collectible card as fragment of a greater apotheosis",

TIGHT FRAMING: Chest up only - this is an intimate portrait, not full-body\n\n=== THE GORGET PORTRAIT CONCEPT ===\nThe silver gorget is the VISUAL CENTERPIECE of this portrait. It dominates the lower third of the frame - the British royal coat of arms (lion and unicorn flanking shield, crown above) rendered in exquisite, gleaming detail. This symbol of loyalty to the Crown rests against the chest of the man who would one day defeat it.\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\n- TIGHT CROP: Washington from chest up only, filling the frame\n- GORGET PLACEMENT: The silver gorget occupies the lower third, catching candlelight\n- FACE: Washington's face in the upper two-thirds, three-quarter view\n- INTIMACY: The viewer is close - almost uncomfortably close - to this man and his emblem of allegiance\n\n=== FIGURE DESCRIPTION ===\nGEORGE WASHINGTON (age ~40, pre-Revolution):\n- Strong jaw, prominent nose, powdered hair tied back in queue\n- Expression: Composed but unreadable - the 'sullen mood' he described during portrait sittings\n- Eyes that give nothing away - dignity, reserve, something held back\n- Younger than most canonical portraits - this is the colonial officer, not the President\n\n=== ATTIRE ===\nVIRGINIA REGIMENT UNIFORM (French and Indian War era):\n- Blue coat with RED facings (NOT buff - this is pre-Continental Army)\n- Silver gorget prominently displayed at throat, engraved with British royal coat of arms\n- White stock (neck cloth) visible beneath the gorget\n- Quality fabric, officer's tailoring - aspiring to English standards\n\n=== THE GORGET (render in detail) ===\n- Polished silver, crescent-shaped officer's gorget\n- Engraved British royal coat of arms: lion and unicorn supporters, quartered shield, crown above\n- Catches and reflects the single candle light source\n- Should GLEAM against the darker uniform - the brightest element in the portrait\n\n=== LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE ===\n- Single candle source from upper left, creating dramatic chiaroscuro\n- Deep shadows on right side of face and background\n- The gorget catches light like a mirror - a bright focal point\n- Dark, nearly black background - no setting visible, just the man and his symbol\n- Warm candlelit tones: amber, deep brown, cream highlights\n\n=== ARTISTIC STYLE ===\nGeorgian-era colonial portraiture in the manner of:\n- Charles Willson Peale's intimate realism\n- John Singleton Copley's smooth modeling and fabric rendering\n- Visible brushwork suggesting oil on canvas\n- Formal composition but with psychological intensity\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS ===\nTOP: \"FOUNDING FATHERS\" in elegant 18th-century serif typography, cream/gold color, subtle\nLAYER BADGE: Small cartouche reading \"Colonial Foundation\" in period script\nBOTTOM: \"Washington\" in complementary serif, with \"1776-2026 | 250 Years\" as small subtitle\n\n=== FINISH ===\nOil painting finish with:\n- Visible brushwork texture\n- Varnished warmth and depth\n- Craquelure (fine aging cracks) suggesting historical artifact\n- Premium collectible card feel",

When Jacob blessed them before his death, he deliberately crossed his hands to put his right hand on Ephraim (the younger) and left on Manasseh (the firstborn). When Joseph tried to correct him, Jacob insisted: 'I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater.'

Expression shifts from jealousy and pragmatism (selling Joseph) to desperate self-sacrifice (offering himself for Benjamin). The brother who transformed.\n- Wearing: shepherd's garments in earth tones — browns and grays, rough wool.

This is STYLIZED ART for a collectible card, not a photograph\n\n=== RIVALRY CONTEXT ===\nThe rivalry between Jacob and Esau\n\n=== DUALITY COMPOSITION ===\nThe card features a LARGE CIRCULAR YIN-YANG-INSPIRED design:\n\nThe central composition is a circle divided by a flowing S-CURVE:\n\nJACOB DOMAIN (upper-left):\n- Background: warm gold/amber tones, representing light/fire\n- Figure: Curved/flowing pose that follows the S-curve border\n- Contains a small circular \"seed\" of Esau's color (yin-yang dot)\n- smooth skin, voice of wisdom, quiet contemplation\n\nESAU DOMAIN (lower-right):\n- Background: deep black/indigo tones, representing shadow/water\n- Figure: Curved/flowing pose that follows the S-curve border\n- Contains a small circular \"seed\" of Jacob's color (yin-yang dot)\n- rough/hairy, physicality, action and instinct\n\nThe S-CURVE where they meet is the point of maximum tension and connection - their backs curved toward each other, or hands almost touching across the divide.\n\n=== FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ===\n\nJACOB (LIGHT/FIRE SIDE):\n- Physical: smooth-skinned man (contrast to hairy Esau), intelligent scheming eyes, neat beard, calculating expression, olive skin, always thinking three moves ahead\n- Wearing: wealthy patriarch's robes, layered fine fabrics, the dress of a successful man who earned it through wit in warm gold/amber tones\n- Pose: Curved, flowing position following the circular composition\n- Body curves along the S-divider, like half of the yin-yang symbol\n- Displaying: shepherd's staff, surrounded by spotted and speckled sheep and goats representing his clever dealings with Laban\n- Style: Elegant, cosmic, slightly ethereal\n- Anatomy: Exactly two arms -

two arms only, may carry bow\n\n=== THE \"SEEDS\" (YIN-YANG DOTS) ===\nCritical element: Each half contains a small circle of the OPPOSITE color:\n- In Jacob's domain: A small deep black/indigo circle containing something of Esau (an eye, a hand, a symbol)\n- In Esau's domain: A small warm gold/amber circle containing something of Jacob (an eye, a hand, a symbol)\n\nThese \"seeds\" represent: \"born together, destined to struggle, cannot exist without the other\"\n\n=== BACKGROUND ===\nCOSMIC/ELEMENTAL contrast:\n- Jacob's half: Gradients of warm gold/amber, smooth transitions, celestial or elemental imagery\n- Esau's half: Gradients of deep black/indigo, smooth transitions, opposite elemental imagery\n- The colors blend smoothly at the S-curve boundary\n- Outer background: Deep cosmic space or subtle gradient vignette\n\nMay include subtle cosmic elements: stars, moons, or elemental symbols appropriate to each side.\n\n=== CIRCULAR FRAME ===\nThe yin-yang composition should be set within a PROMINENT CIRCLE:\n- Clean, bold circular border containing the duality design\n- May be gold, silver, or contrasting to both halves\n- The circle represents completeness - the two halves make a whole\n\n=== BORDER & FRAME ===\nModern, clean border with cosmic undertones:\n- Dark outer border (deep blue, purple, or black)\n- Subtle starfield or gradient effect\n- The central circle is the hero of the composition\n- Minimal decoration to let the duality speak\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified) ===\nTOP: \"TORAH TITANS\" in clean, modern serif font with subtle metallic sheen\n- Centered above the circular composition\n- Balanced, understated typography\n\nSUBTITLE: \"Sibling Duality\" in elegant script or small caps below\n\nBOTTOM: \"Jacob & Esau\" in balanced text\n- Positioned below the circle\n- May use \" / \" or \"&\" to connect the names\n\nAROUND THE CIRCLE (optional):\nHebrew letters or words relating to the duality theme may arc around the circular border\n\n=== COLOR RELATIONSHIPS ===\nSuggested color pairs (use what fits the specific pairing):\n- Gold/Amber vs Black/Indigo (light vs dark)\n- Fire orange/red vs Water blue/teal (fire vs water)\n- Day gold/white vs Night blue/black (day vs night)\n- Warm earth tones vs Cool sky tones (earth vs sky)\n\nThe key is HIGH CONTRAST while maintaining visual harmony.\n\n=== FINISH ===\nSmooth, cosmic aesthetic:\n- Clean gradients without harsh edges\n- Subtle metallic or iridescent sheen on the circular border\n- Colors flow and blend beautifully\n- Premium collectible card with philosophical depth\n- Mood: \"Opposites define each other\", \"Cannot exist without the other\", \"Two halves of one whole\"",

All figures must have exactly TWO ARMS\n6. This is STYLIZED ART for a collectible card, not a photograph\n7. All figures must be FULLY VISIBLE - no body parts cut off by the die-cut edge\n\n=== INTERACTION: CUSTOM ACTION ===\nOverall: Shaquille O'Neal and Goliath performing their signature moves in parallel\nEnergy/Mood: powerful, legendary, parallel greatness\n\nSHAQUILLE O'NEAL POSE:\nexecuting signature drop step spin move in the post - MASSIVE 7'1\" body pivoting with surprising agility, ball protected, about to rise for unstoppable close-range power dunk, focused determined expression\n\nGOLIATH POSE:\nTOWERING GIANT in moment of defeat - nearly 10 feet of warrior FALLING face-forward, stone embedded in forehead, eyes wide with shock, massive spear dropping from limp hand, bronze armor clanging, the impossible happening - a giant falls\n\n=== FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ===\n\nSHAQUILLE O'NEAL:\n- Physical: MASSIVE 7'1\" 325-pound frame, incredibly muscular, shaved head, playful yet intimidating expression, dark skin, largest player on any court\n- Wearing: PLAIN SOLID PURPLE basketball tank top and shorts with gold trim.

Goliath (biblical figure) must be on the RIGHT side of the card.\n\nThe two figures are positioned IN FRONT OF a large basketball, which serves as both background element and visual anchor. Figures should be prominent but not obscure the ball entirely - they frame it or stand before it.\n\nFIGURE PLACEMENT: Both figures must be FULLY CONTAINED within the die-cut boundary. Keep a safe margin from all edges - no arms, legs, heads, or clothing should extend into the die-cut zone. The irregular flame edges should frame empty background/gradient space, never cutting through the figures.\n\n=== BACKGROUND ===\nDOMINANT BASKETBALL: A large SPALDING-STYLE BASKETBALL fills 60-70% of the card, positioned centrally. The ball is the focal point - orange leather with black seam lines, rendered in detail.\n\nGRADIENT: A flat horizontal gradient spans the ENTIRE card background from left to right:\n- LEFT EDGE: YELLOW (5% of card width)\n- CENTER-LEFT to CENTER: ORANGE (15% of card width)\n- CENTER to RIGHT EDGE: DEEP RED (80% of card width)\n\nThis is a FLAT color wash across the background - NOT radiating from the ball, NOT surrounding the ball. The basketball sits ON TOP of this gradient, not inside it. There should be NO yellow glow or halo around the ball.\n\nDIE-CUT EDGE: The card has an IRREGULAR, JAGGED die-cut border on the TOP and SIDES - flame-like shapes, asymmetrical and dynamic. The BOTTOM edge is STRAIGHT and EVEN with gently CURVED CORNERS.\n\nThe die-cut has THREE layers from inside to outside:\n1. Card content (gradient/ball/figures)\n2. VERY THIN BLACK HAIRLINE tracing the irregular edge (1-2 pixels, barely visible)\n3. Pure WHITE exterior beyond the cut\n\nThe black line is a HAIRLINE - extremely thin, just enough to define the edge. The contrast of gradient → hairline black → white exterior makes the die-cut crisp.\n\nIMPORTANT: The die-cut is UNEVEN on top and sides only. Bottom is a clean straight edge with rounded corners, like a traditional card base.\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified) ===\nTITLE: Write \"Hot Shots\" in elegant GOLD SCRIPT font, positioned in the TOP CORNER (left or right, whichever balances the composition). The script should be cursive and stylish, with a subtle shine. NOT centered, NOT across the full top.\n\nNAMES: Write \"Shaquille O'Neal\" and \"Goliath\" in SLIM GOLD CHARACTERS that curve ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BASKETBALL. The names follow the circular contour of the ball. Elegant, thin lettering that complements the ball's shape.\n\nLOGO: At the BOTTOM CENTER of the card, render the \"Court & Covenant\" logo SMALL in GOLD. Keep it crisp, positioned along the straight bottom edge.\n\n=== FINISH ===\nHigh-gloss premium finish with the intensity of a 90s insert card.",

      "prompt": "A vertical premium basketball card in 3:4 aspect ratio, styled after 1996-97 Flair Showcase \"Hot Shots\" die-cut insert set.\n\n=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===\n1. The basketball player's jersey AND SHORTS must be COMPLETELY BLANK - solid purple color only with orange trim, like an unlabeled practice uniform\n2. The shorts are PLAIN SOLID PURPLE FABRIC - NO diamond shape, NO logo, NO emblem, NO symbol, NO design whatsoever\n3. DO NOT add any team names, NBA logos, Nike swoosh, Jordan logo, or any brand marks\n4. DO NOT add any numbers, letters, or symbols to the jersey or shorts\n5. All figures must have exactly TWO ARMS\n6. This is STYLIZED ART for a collectible card, not a photograph\n7. All figures must be FULLY VISIBLE - no body parts cut off by the die-cut edge\n\n=== INTERACTION: CUSTOM ACTION ===\nOverall: Charles Barkley and Caleb performing their signature moves in parallel\nEnergy/Mood: powerful, legendary, parallel greatness\n\nCHARLES BARKLEY POSE:\ngrabbing rebound with both hands above head - elbows out wide clearing space, stocky powerful body coiled, feet spread for balance, fierce expression, muscles tensed, about to outlet pass\n\nCALEB POSE:\nhand raised silencing fearful crowd before Moses - standing tall against the tide of doubt, eyes blazing with confidence, the one voice saying 'we can do this'\n\n=== FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ===\n\nCHARLES BARKLEY:\n- Physical: 6'6\" power forward, stocky muscular build, undersized but dominant, expressive face\n- Wearing: PLAIN SOLID PURPLE basketball tank top and shorts with orange trim. The uniform is COMPLETELY BLANK - solid color fabric only. NO logos, NO diamonds, NO symbols of any kind.\n- Style: Stylized artistic rendering, recognizable likeness but NOT photorealistic\n\nCALEB:\n- Physical: strong and capable despite age, confident bearing, eyes that see victory where others see defeat\n- Wearing: traveling robes suitable for scouting, leather sandals, carrying pole for grapes\n- Style: Classical artistic interpretation, biblical period accurate\n- Anatomy: Exactly two arms - two arms, often carrying grapes or raised in confident gesture\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\nIMPORTANT: Charles Barkley (basketball player) must be on the LEFT side of the card. Caleb (biblical figure) must be on the RIGHT side of the card.\n\nThe two figures are positioned IN FRONT OF a large basketball, which serves as both background element and visual anchor. Figures should be prominent but not obscure the ball entirely - they frame it or stand before it.\n\nFIGURE PLACEMENT: Both figures must be FULLY CONTAINED within the die-cut boundary. Keep a safe margin from all edges - no arms, legs, heads, or clothing should extend into the die-cut zone. The irregular flame edges should frame empty background/gradient space, never cutting through the figures.\n\n=== BACKGROUND ===\nDOMINANT BASKETBALL: A large SPALDING-STYLE BASKETBALL fills 60-70% of the card, positioned centrally. The ball is the focal point - orange leather with black seam lines, rendered in detail.\n\nGRADIENT: A flat horizontal gradient spans the ENTIRE card background from left to right:\n- LEFT EDGE: YELLOW (5% of card width)\n- CENTER-LEFT to CENTER: ORANGE (15% of card width)\n- CENTER to RIGHT EDGE: DEEP RED (80% of card width)\n\nThis is a FLAT color wash across the background - NOT radiating from the ball, NOT surrounding the ball. The basketball sits ON TOP of this gradient, not inside it. There should be NO yellow glow or halo around the ball.\n\nDIE-CUT EDGE: The card has an IRREGULAR, JAGGED die-cut border on the TOP and SIDES - flame-like shapes, asymmetrical and dynamic. The BOTTOM edge is STRAIGHT and EVEN with gently CURVED CORNERS.\n\nThe die-cut has THREE layers from inside to outside:\n1. Card content (gradient/ball/figures)\n2. VERY THIN BLACK HAIRLINE tracing the irregular edge (1-2 pixels, barely visible)\n3. Pure WHITE exterior beyond the cut\n\nThe black line is a HAIRLINE - extremely thin, just enough to define the edge. The contrast of gradient → hairline black → white exterior makes the die-cut crisp.\n\nIMPORTANT: The die-cut is UNEVEN on top and sides only. Bottom is a clean straight edge with rounded corners, like a traditional card base.\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified) ===\nTITLE: Write \"Hot Shots\" in elegant GOLD SCRIPT font, positioned in the TOP CORNER (left or right, whichever balances the composition). The script should be cursive and stylish, with a subtle shine. NOT centered, NOT across the full top.\n\nNAMES: Write \"Charles Barkley\" and \"Caleb\" in SLIM GOLD CHARACTERS that curve ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BASKETBALL. The names follow the circular contour of the ball. Elegant, thin lettering that complements the ball's shape.\n\nLOGO: At the BOTTOM CENTER of the card, render the \"Court & Covenant\" logo SMALL in GOLD. Keep it crisp, positioned along the straight bottom edge.\n\n=== FINISH ===\nHigh-gloss premium finish with the intensity of a 90s insert card.",
