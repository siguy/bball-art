All figures must have exactly TWO ARMS\n6. This is STYLIZED ART for a collectible card, not a photograph\n\n=== INTERACTION: CUSTOM ACTION ===\nOverall: Allen Iverson and Gideon performing their signature moves in parallel\nEnergy/Mood: powerful, legendary, parallel greatness\n\nALLEN IVERSON POSE:\nexecuting signature crossover - body extremely LOW to the ground in athletic crouch, explosive lateral shift with weight transferring hard to one side, ball carried low and wide in one hand, upper body leaning into the fake, defender stumbling backwards with ankles broken, cornrows whipping with the explosive change of direction\n\nGIDEON POSE:\nstanding before his 300 chosen warriors at night - torches and empty jars ready, small band against massive army, unconventional warfare about to begin\n\n=== FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ===\n\nALLEN IVERSON:\n- Physical: 6'0\" guard, small but explosive, cornrows, tattoos, arm sleeve, cultural icon\n- Wearing: PLAIN SOLID RED basketball tank top and shorts with blue trim.

Gideon (biblical figure) must be on the RIGHT side of the card.

The fire gradient flows from white-hot center through bright yellow, orange, to deep red at the edges.\n\nThe card edges fade to BLACK VOID, simulating a die-cut effect where flames meet darkness. Flames should appear to burst around and behind the figures, creating an \"on fire\" intensity.\n\nNO cosmic elements, NO stars, NO nebulae - this is PURE FIRE AND HEAT.\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified) ===\nTOP: Write \"HOT SHOTS\" in bold, dramatic font with FIRE GRADIENT (red at bottom, orange in middle, yellow at top).

All figures must have exactly TWO ARMS\n6. This is STYLIZED ART for a collectible card, not a photograph\n7. All figures must be FULLY VISIBLE - no body parts cut off by the die-cut edge\n\n=== INTERACTION: CUSTOM ACTION ===\nOverall: Shaquille O'Neal and Goliath performing their signature moves in parallel\nEnergy/Mood: powerful, legendary, parallel greatness\n\nSHAQUILLE O'NEAL POSE:\nexecuting signature drop step spin move in the post - MASSIVE 7'1\" body pivoting with surprising agility, ball protected, about to rise for unstoppable close-range power dunk, focused determined expression\n\nGOLIATH POSE:\nTOWERING GIANT in moment of defeat - nearly 10 feet of warrior FALLING face-forward, stone embedded in forehead, eyes wide with shock, massive spear dropping from limp hand, bronze armor clanging, the impossible happening - a giant falls\n\n=== FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ===\n\nSHAQUILLE O'NEAL:\n- Physical: MASSIVE 7'1\" 325-pound frame, incredibly muscular, shaved head, playful yet intimidating expression, dark skin, largest player on any court\n- Wearing: PLAIN SOLID PURPLE basketball tank top and shorts with gold trim.

Goliath (biblical figure) must be on the RIGHT side of the card.\n\nThe two figures are positioned IN FRONT OF a large basketball, which serves as both background element and visual anchor. Figures should be prominent but not obscure the ball entirely - they frame it or stand before it.\n\nFIGURE PLACEMENT: Both figures must be FULLY CONTAINED within the die-cut boundary. Keep a safe margin from all edges - no arms, legs, heads, or clothing should extend into the die-cut zone. The irregular flame edges should frame empty background/gradient space, never cutting through the figures.\n\n=== BACKGROUND ===\nDOMINANT BASKETBALL: A large SPALDING-STYLE BASKETBALL fills 60-70% of the card, positioned centrally.

The basketball sits ON TOP of this gradient, not inside it. There should be NO yellow glow or halo around the ball.\n\nDIE-CUT EDGE: The card has an IRREGULAR, JAGGED die-cut border on the TOP and SIDES - flame-like shapes, asymmetrical and dynamic. The BOTTOM edge is STRAIGHT and EVEN with gently CURVED CORNERS.\n\nThe die-cut has THREE layers from inside to outside:\n1. Card content (gradient/ball/figures)\n2. VERY THIN BLACK HAIRLINE tracing the irregular edge (1-2 pixels, barely visible)\n3. Pure WHITE exterior beyond the cut\n\nThe black line is a HAIRLINE - extremely thin, just enough to define the edge. The contrast of gradient → hairline black → white exterior makes the die-cut crisp.\n\nIMPORTANT: The die-cut is UNEVEN on top and sides only. Bottom is a clean straight edge with rounded corners, like a traditional card base.\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified) ===\nTITLE: Write \"Hot Shots\" in elegant GOLD SCRIPT font, positioned in the TOP CORNER (left or right, whichever balances the composition). The script should be cursive and stylish, with a subtle shine. NOT centered, NOT across the full top.\n\nNAMES: Write \"Shaquille O'Neal\" and \"Goliath\" in SLIM GOLD CHARACTERS that curve ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BASKETBALL. The names follow the circular contour of the ball. Elegant, thin lettering that complements the ball's shape.\n\nLOGO: At the BOTTOM CENTER of the card, render the \"Court & Covenant\" logo SMALL in GOLD. Keep it crisp, positioned along the straight bottom edge.\n\n=== FINISH ===\nHigh-gloss premium finish with the intensity of a 90s insert card.",

The uniform is COMPLETELY BLANK - solid color fabric only. NO logos, NO diamonds, NO symbols of any kind.\n- Style: Stylized artistic rendering, recognizable likeness but NOT photorealistic\n\nKING DAVID:\n- Physical: young and handsome, RUDDY complexion with reddish hair (as described in 1 Samuel 16:12), beautiful eyes, strong shepherd's build\n- Wearing: royal robes in purple and blue over simple tunic, ancient Israelite style NOT medieval\n- Style: Classical artistic interpretation, biblical period accurate\n- Anatomy: Exactly two arms - two arms only\n\n=== COMPOSITION ===\nIMPORTANT: LeBron James (basketball player) must be on the LEFT side of the card. King David (biblical figure) must be on the RIGHT side of the card.\n\nThe two figures are positioned IN FRONT OF a large basketball, which serves as both background element and visual anchor. Figures should be prominent but not obscure the ball entirely - they frame it or stand before it.\n\n=== BACKGROUND ===\nDOMINANT BASKETBALL: A large SPALDING-STYLE BASKETBALL fills 60-70% of the card, positioned centrally. The ball is the focal point - orange leather with black seam lines, rendered in detail.\n\nGRADIENT BEHIND BALL: Behind the basketball, a simple gradient fills the card area:\n- 80% DEEP RED (dominant color, outer areas)\n- 15% ORANGE (transition zone)\n- 5% YELLOW (subtle highlight near center/ball)\n\nThe gradient radiates outward from behind the ball. Keep it simple - no flames, no cosmic effects, just clean color transition.\n\nDIE-CUT EDGE: The card has an IRREGULAR, JAGGED die-cut border - NOT a clean rectangle. The edge follows organic flame-like shapes, asymmetrical and dynamic.\n\nThe die-cut has THREE layers from inside to outside:\n1. Card content (gradient/ball/figures)\n2. THIN BLACK OUTLINE tracing the irregular edge\n3. Pure WHITE exterior beyond the cut\n\nThe black line is thin but crisp, defining the flame-shaped silhouette. The contrast of red gradient → black edge → white exterior makes the die-cut pop.\n\nIMPORTANT: The die-cut is UNEVEN - some edges cut deeper into the card than others, creating visual interest. This is a premium 90s insert effect.\n\n=== TEXT ELEMENTS (render exactly as specified) ===\nTITLE: Write \"Hot Shots\" in elegant GOLD SCRIPT font, positioned in the TOP CORNER (left or right, whichever balances the composition). The script should be cursive and stylish, with a subtle shine. NOT centered, NOT across the full top.\n\nLOGO: Near the title, render the \"Court & Covenant\" logo VERY SMALL in GOLD. Keep it crisp.\n\nNAMES: Write \"LeBron James\" and \"David\" in SLIM GOLD CHARACTERS that curve ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BASKETBALL. The names follow the circular contour of the ball, not placed on a straight line at the bottom. Elegant, thin lettering that complements the ball's shape.\n\n=== FINISH ===\nHigh-gloss premium finish with the intensity of a 90s insert card.",

Very bright and eye-catching. Add \"SHADOW SPECTRUM\" in smaller crimson text below.
